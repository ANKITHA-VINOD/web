                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">For a very few, it is part of their life, for some others it is something they try and inculcate into their lives and for the rest this is just another stupidity. Open the newspaper and you get examples of what exactly "humanity" should not be like. Now take a magnifying glass and search for the most seemingly insignificant pieces of news and Hola! You would have probably found out examples of this "humanity" . Well, this is the condition of "humanity" these days. Where did humanity originate from? Well, obvious from the name itself, humanity took birth from none other than humans. It is the quality of being human- the essence of human nature. Being human means to incorporate certain values into one that would be beneficial for the rest. Essentially, humanity should be a unavoidable part of every human. It urges us to help each other, have compassion, empathy, sympathy and above all a mind to forgive and let go. 
<br>
<br>Helping is of paramount importance when it comes to being human. Being contrary to what is usually perceived, helping shouldn't necessarily include only physical things. Showing the patience to lend emotional help, the patience to listen to each other and also encouraging others to complete their tasks and lending them our time also comes under helping. We must also learn to be polite to others. Sometimes, caught in the fast pace of the modern world, all of the people we meet might not really reciprocate with the same feelings as we did to them and to be human is to realise that it is completely okay to receive negative reactions. We should be open to such criticisms. We must realise and have humanity in us enough to understand things from others perspective. We never know what the other person might be going through. We don't know their story , we have no idea how the world looks from their view. Hence we must be understanding . We must have compassion and love within us.&nbsp;</p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">Love&nbsp;</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Love- the very misunderstood word these days. Is it those emotional drama shown in serials and rom-com movies? No that isn't love! It is drama, a written down script. What is then love? It is that emotional feeling and attachment that we must have to our fellow beings- be it humans or animals. It is that passionate feeling we have for others that further urges us to help and stand for them. But beware! Love isn't that mushy and mawkish stuffs shown in the films- Love is that psychic attachment we have to people close to us- our parents, our friends, our partner, our pets. Now is that human? Loving people close to you and only pitching in with them doesn't count as humane- as humanity because it is unfortunately just a synonym for selfishness. Love becomes humane or a behaviour of humanity only when we have that compassionate feeling of love to people whom we don't even know! It is that mucking in with total strangers in situations when they are alone, it is guiding someone out of service, it is forgiving random people for insignificant mistakes. Above all , to Love means to be free of Ego.&nbsp;<br><br>In effect, humanity simply means those positive virtues that every human is expected to possess. Humanity resides in humans. Does the vice versa hold true? Are all humans humane? Well, sadly that isn't the case. As self evident as it is, some organisms classified as humans are humane, possess humanity while the rest and the majority are just organisms classified as animals. Now the present state of the world undeniably draws us to be despondent about the reality. But are all hopes lost? Again unequivocally let's accept that no, all humanity hasn't lost yet. There are still so many wonderful people out there who does small and large acts of humanity out of love and gentleness , not expecting anything in return or not expecting people to thank them. Real humans don't actually crave for attention for things they have done out of goodwill and concern.&nbsp;<br></p>
