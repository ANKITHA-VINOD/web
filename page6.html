                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Social media has undoubtedly become an inevitable part of our lives. It rules our thoughts and actions. They always say what to do and what not to do. People judge others based on their appearance in social media platforms- they don’t care if the photo was edited or the post had lines which were taken from somewhere else, it doesn’t matter at all. At this age, you are successful in creating a better social media image for you- you kind of win at everything according to ‘some’ people. What they say is that it is your social media image that matters more than what you are actually as a human being. <br>
<br>Most of the times, the posts in social medias do no actually reflect what had happened in real life. But todays generation, doesn’t care about reality. All they need is a colourful post! So for this very reason, people fake themselves in social media platforms so as to showcase themselves as rich, happy, pretty and content. When in reality, the truth could have been the totally opposite.&nbsp;</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                    Social media take out many of our otherwise productive time without us even noticing it. We fall into the trap of watching those colourful posts that actually we never get tired. Click on that ‘explore ‘ button in any app- and there you are, you get some amazing and most trending posts and then you find yourself unable to stop yourself from scrolling down, wrestlestly searching for newer posts. Or it can also happen that you put up some new posts and you are so eager to know who all liked or disliked or commented or shared that post. You are eager to reply to the comments. You are so curious to know what is happening with your new posts that you cant stop yourself from exiting from the app so you keep on scrolling in it and then time just slips by.It is only at the end of the day that you realize that you have wasted so much of your time in in some posts that you don’t even remember now.</p>

</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                    Whenever you put some posts you are actually very much worried about how other are going conceive it or view it. To put it simple, you are constantly thinking about how others are going to think about you purely based on these mere posts.When you put a new posts in these platforms, then you find yourself constantly checking for new updates even though in reality the activity for the post is very down. Now in case, the activity is much lower than what you expected, then you may feel like your posts are less wanted now or that your posts are ugly and that people have started disliking you. But thr truth may have n=been something else. It mught be some technical glitch or it could be some other unexplained issues.And then you become anxious to know what happened with your posts. You feel like people have started judging you the arong way. And you start losing your confidence. </p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Social media do not always show the truth. Sometimes people just put fake posts so as to make other people have a false notion about them. But the sad fact is that there are some stupid people who believe in these fake posts. There a are people who put their completely edited photos and things online. And there are others who get sad looking at these posts wondering why they are not like those who get thousands of likes to their posts. They don’t actually realize that this is all Photoshop and that this is not reality. You become sad thinking that you are not beautiful or pretty or rich like them and that you are not enjoying life or staying happy like them. But the truth could have been the totally opposite also.When you waste your time in some unwanted posts you actually end up doing nothing productive. You see some fake posts put by someone else and now you are worried about it. You are literally wasting your time over something useless. <br></p>

</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">These days there are a lot of fake posts circulating in social media that are used to create fake notions about people or entities. Many of these are actually aimed at creating communal violence or hatred against a sector of people or particular person. But the sad reality is that the vast majority of social media users actually end up believing such posts and further starts sharing and circulating them creating more worries and chaos.It is also very hard to control or realize which are fake posts. At time of distress or some disasters, when social media should actually be used to spread awareness or important alerts and news and used to help others, sometimes due to these fake posts , people actually tend to become more worried and spreads more chaos and confusion.We should be very careful at such times and before sharing or commenting on any post, we must make sure about the genuinity of the posts. And what social implications this post may contain. <br></p>
